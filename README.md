This project is meant for people with great skills to showcase them and earn reward while doing so :)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [React App Rewined](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired)
For any Steemconnect interactions we use [sc2-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sc2-sdk)

yarn install
yarn start
