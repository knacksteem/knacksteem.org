# knacksteem-front

This project is meant for people with great skills to showcase them and earn reward while doing so :)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and [React App Rewined](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired)
For any Steemconnect interactions we use [sc2-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sc2-sdk)


## How to Use

For now you just have to:

```

yarn install
yarn start

```

Make sure the Backend Server/API is running: https://github.com/knacksteem/knacksteem-api


## Dev server recompiling
If running the development server (`yarn start`) in a virtual machine or container environment (e.g. Docker), the changes made to the filesystem might not get picked up. If so, you can still use live-reloading by changing the configuration of the development server. Modify `config-overrides.js` to uncomment the line setting the `poll` property and the development server should then pick up your changes as you modify the files.
